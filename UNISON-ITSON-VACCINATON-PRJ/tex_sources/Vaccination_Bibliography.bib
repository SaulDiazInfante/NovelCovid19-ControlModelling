  abstract  = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by
  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most
  formidable challenge to humanity in a century. It is widely believed that
  prepandemic normalcy will never return until a safe and effective vaccine
  strategy becomes available and a global vaccination programme is implemented
  successfully. Here, we discuss the immunological principles that need to be
  taken into consideration in the development of COVID-19 vaccine strategies.
  On the basis of these principles, we examine the current COVID-19 vaccine
  candidates, their strengths and potential shortfalls, and make inferences
  about their chances of success. Finally, we discuss the scientific and
  practical challenges that will be faced in the process of developing a
  successful vaccine and the ways in which COVID-19 vaccine strategies may
  evolve over the next few years.},
