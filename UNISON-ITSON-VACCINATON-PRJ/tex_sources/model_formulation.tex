In this section, we formulate our baseline mathematical model,
which additionally to the transmission dynamics, includes vaccination.
In order to build our  model, we follow the classical Kermack-McKendrick
approach. \Cref{Fig:SchemeModel} shows the compartmental diagram of
our mathematical model.

        Susceptible $(S)$, exposed $(E)$, symptomatic infected $(I_S)$, asymptomatic
        infected $(I_A)$, recovered $(R)$, death $(D)$ and vaccinated $(V)$
        individuals. It is important to mention that $I_{S}$ represents the
        proportion of symptomatic individuals who will later report
        to some health medical center.}

Information about reinfection dynamics on COVID-19
disease is unclear to date. However, to explore some scenarios related
to this dynamic, we assume that reinfection is possible after a period
of time. On the other hand, we model the vaccination process considering
some assumptions: i) Vaccination is applied to all the alive individuals
except those in the symptomatic class. In this situation, vaccines are
applied indiscriminately over individuals on the $S$, $E$, $I_A$, and
$R$ classes; ii) the vaccine has preventive nature, that is, only
reflected in the susceptible individuals $(S)$; iii) people will only get
one vaccine during the campaign, and iv) vaccines do not necessarily have
a hundred percent of effectivity, which implies that some vaccinated people
can get the disease. We denote the effectivity rate by $\epsilon$.
Based on these assumptions our model becomes
\begin{equation}\label{model1}
    \begin{aligned}
        S'(t) &= \mu \bar{N}-\frac{\beta_S I_S +
            \beta_AI_A}{\bar{N}}S - (\mu+\lambda_V)S +
        \delta_V V+ \delta_R R
        \\
        E'(t) &= \frac{\beta_S I_S + \beta_AI_A}{\bar{N}}S+
        (1-\epsilon) \frac{\beta_S I_S+\beta_AI_A}{\bar{N}}V-(\mu+\delta_E) E
        \\
        I'_S(t) &=
        p \delta_E E-(\mu+\alpha_S) I_S
        \\
        I'_A(t) &= (1-p) \delta_E E-(\mu+\alpha_A) I_A
        \\
        R'(t)&= (1-\theta) \alpha_S I_S +
        \alpha_A I_A-(\mu+\delta_R) R
        \\
        D'(t) &= \theta \alpha_S I_S
        \\
        V'(t) &= \lambda_V S-(1-\epsilon)
        \frac{\beta_S I_S + \beta_AI_A}{\bar{N}}V - (\mu+\delta_V) V
        \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where $\bar{N}(t)=S(t)+E(t)+I_S(t)+I_A(t)+R(t)+V(t)$ and
$N=\bar{N}+D$. Additionally, we include the equations
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:model1_counters}
    \begin{aligned}
        X'(t) &=
        \lambda_V(S + E + I_A + R)
        \\
        Y'_{I_S}(t) &=p
        \delta_E E,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $X(t)$ and $Y_{I_S}(t)$ represent the cumulative doses at time $t$,
and the cumulative incidence at time $t$, respectively.

\subsection{Baseline parameters value and initial conditions}
It is now necessary to define a set of baseline parameter
values to explore some scenarios of interest. In the present work,
we consider Mexico City plus Mexico state as our study region and use
COVID-19 data to estimate some parameter values. We follow a Bayesian
approach to address this problem. We use a negative binomial
distribution as an observation model, in which the mean parameter
is given by
\begin{equation*}\label{incidence}
    \begin{aligned}
        I_{SA}(k) = Y_{I_S}(k) - Y_{I_S}(k-1)=\int_{k-1}^k p\delta_EE dt,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $I_{SA}(k)$ represents the incidence per day of
infected symptomatic individuals at the $k-th$ day.
The parameter estimation splits into two-stage:
before and after mitigation measures were implemented,
and we only focus on the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak.
\Cref{Fig:fittingcurve} shows fitting curves with their respective
confidence bands for both stages. Here, we observe that our estimations
follow the growth profile of the epidemic curve. For more information about
the parameter estimation process, see \Cref{App:Parameter_Est}.
\Cref{table_icparam4} resume our parameter calibration.

On the other hand, since it is unclear when the vaccines will be available,
then we assume that our scenarios start on the growth stage of a second
outbreak (see \Cref{Fig:initial_conditions}) with the objective of starting
under a plausible scenario. Thus, for numerical results, initial conditions
normalized with total population
$N = \num{26446435}$, result
